Silver Redirector is a simple and flexible WordPress plugin that allows you to set up URL redirections for specific dates. You can create and delete redirect rules easily from the WordPress admin panel.

## Features
- Redirect any URL to another on a specific date.
- Add or delete redirects from the WordPress admin interface.
- Designed to handle multiple redirects efficiently without slowing down your site.
- Safe uninstall: removes all plugin data when uninstalled.

## How It Works
Once activated, the plugin allows you to manage redirects from the **Tools > Silver Redirector** section in the WordPress admin panel. You can specify a "From URL" and a "To URL" for each redirect, as well as the date on which the redirect should become active.

### Example
If you want to redirect `https://yourdomain.com/offer` to `https://yourdomain.com/special-offer` on **December 1, 2024**, you can set up a rule for that date, and the redirect will occur automatically.

## Installation
1. Download the plugin or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Activate the plugin via the **Plugins** menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate to **Tools > Silver Redirector** to start adding redirects.
